The if Statement
=======================================================================================================================================
The if statement is used to execute some code if a condition is true.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
   statements
}

The condition specifies which expression is to be evaluated. If the condition is true, the statements in the curly brackets are executed.
If the condition is false, the statements are simply ignored, and the program continues to run after the if statements body.

Use relational operators to evaluate conditions.
if(7>4)
{
 cout<<"yes";
}
The if statement evaluates the condition (7>4), finds it to be true, and then executes the cout statement.
If we change the greater operator to a less than operator (7<4), the statement will not be executed and nothing will be printed out.
A condition specified in an if statement does not require a semicolon.
additional relational operator
>= greater than equal to
<= less than equal to
== equal to
!= not equal to

The not equal to operator evaluates the operands, determines whether or not they are equal. 
If the operands are not equal, the condition is evaluated to true.

You can use relational operators to compare variables in the if statement.
For example:
int a = 55;
int b = 33;
if(a>b)
{
 cout<<"a is greater than b
}

The else Statement

An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the condition is false.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
  //statements
}
else {
 //statements
}

The code above will test the condition:
- If it evaluates to true, then the code inside the if statement will be executed.
- If it evaluates to false, then the code inside the else statement will be executed.
When only one statement is used inside the if/else, then the curly braces can be omitted.
you may include as many statements as you want inside else statement.
