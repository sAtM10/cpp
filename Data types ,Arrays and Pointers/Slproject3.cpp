/*You are working on a ticketing system. A ticket costs $10.
The office is running a discount campaign: each group of 5 people is getting a discount, 
which is determined by the age of the youngest person in the group.
You need to create a program that takes the ages of all 5 people 
as input and outputs the total price of the tickets.*/
